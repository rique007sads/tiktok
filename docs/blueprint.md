## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Electric blue (#7DF9FF) to reflect the modern, tech-forward nature of the electric scooter. This vivid color is attention-grabbing, and it references electricity without literally suggesting the color yellow. 
- Background color: Light gray (#EEEEEE), nearly white, provides a clean, neutral backdrop to showcase the product and make key information pop.
- Accent color: Teal (#45B8AC), a desaturated analogous color, offers a complementary contrast, and signifies environmental friendliness.
- Headline font: 'Poppins', sans-serif. This provides a geometric, contemporary look.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', sans-serif. It gives a slightly warmer, more friendly feel for displaying the written details, which encourages buyers to read product information. This is paired with the headlines to avoid an overly techy feel. 
- Use minimalist icons to represent features like battery life, speed, and safety.
- Ensure a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
